Runv3 is the main file to run, the rest are various dependencies. Finishrunv3 is what you run if you stop it prematurely but still want to keep going with sorting etc. getchannellist is used by Socketv2. All other things (including Socketv2) are used in Runv3. <br />

This bot will not run as-is. It needs to be modified to add a list of channels to scrape and doesn't have a username or password to connect to Twitch with. These are pretty easy to add, but I won't put my own here for obvious reasons (i.e., my account info and research participant privacy).
