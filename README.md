Runv3 is the main file to run, the rest are various dependencies. Finishrunv3 is what you run if you stop it prematurely but still want to keep going with sorting etc. getchannellist is used by Socketv2. All other things (including Socketv2) are used in Runv3. <br />

This currently won't work for various reasons, namely it doesn't have a list of channels to sort and doesn't have a username or password to connect to Twitch with. I have these, but won't post them.
